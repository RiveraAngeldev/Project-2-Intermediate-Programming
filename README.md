## 📘 Project Description

This repository contains the second programming project for the course **ENGI 223 – Intermediate Programming**.  
The goal is to apply C++ programming concepts through analysis, flowchart creation, and code implementation for four exercises.

Each exercise includes:
1. **Analysis**
2. **Flowchart**
3. **C++ Program**

---

## 🧠 Exercises

### **1️⃣ Exercise 1 – Character Access Using `at()`**
Determine the values of `text.at(0)`, `text.at(3)`, and `text.at(10)` for the following strings:

a. `ahora es el momento`  
b. `el mapache rocky le da la bienvenida`  
c. `Felices fiestas`  
d. `El buen barco`

---

### **2️⃣ Exercise 2 – Reverse String**
Using the `at()` method, write a C++ program that reads a string with `getline()` and displays it in reverse order.

---

### **3️⃣ Exercise 3 – Character Counter**
Write a C++ program that takes a string and a single character from the user, then counts how many times that character appears in the string.

---

### **4️⃣ Exercise 4 – Ohm’s Law (Arrays)**
Create three one-dimensional arrays:  
`current[10]`, `resistance[10]`, and `voltage[10]`.

Each `voltage[i]` should be the product of the corresponding `current[i]` and `resistance[i]`.
